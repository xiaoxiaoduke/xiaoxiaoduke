- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Xiaoxiao Zhou (å‘¨ç­±ç­±), an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, starting in August 2024. Before this, I completed my postdoctoral fellowship at Duke University in the Department of Statistical Science under the mentorship of Fan Li.

- ðŸ”¬ My research passion lies in applying statistical methods to real-world challenges, with a focus on causal inference. I specialize in intercurrent events, causal mediation analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and survival analysis, aiming to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

- ðŸ‘€ Outside of academia, you'll find me immersed in activities like weight lifting, mountain hiking, wall climbing, and runningâ€”always up for a new adventure!

- ðŸ“« You can reach me best via email at zhoux@uab.edu. Feel free to connect for discussions or collaborations.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her/hers
